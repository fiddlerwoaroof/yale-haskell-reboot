;;; Keep track of all compilation units defined.
;;; This has to go here and not in compile.scm because we don't want this
;;; list reinitialized every time that file is loaded.

(define compilation-units '())


;;; Load this file first; it defines the basic compilation system support.
;;; It doesn't matter if this ends up loading source because we'll compile
;;; and reload it below.  

(load "support/compile.scm")


;;; Define a real compilation unit for shared support files.
